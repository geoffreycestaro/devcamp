      <p>With over a decade of experience as a tech leader I have had the opportunity to work with and learn from many great people in my career. Now it's time to get back to what I love &#8212 engineering. The development of web applications is my passion, and I am taking time to learn new technologies and re-direct my career as a software developer.
